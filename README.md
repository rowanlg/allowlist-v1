# Allowlist App V1

This is a project that allows users to join an allowlist, or whitelist. They must sign in with twitter and connect their ethereum wallet, and upon submitting will be allowed access to the list.

Additional features will include limited use URLs, checks if the twitter account is following or has liked a particular post and many more...
